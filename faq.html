                    Visa requirements depend on your country of origin. Generally, visitors from visa-exempt countries can enter Canada for tourism purposes without a visa. However, they may need an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA).

                    To check if you need a visa or an eTA, visit the official website of the Government of Canada's immigration and citizenship section. Ensure you have the necessary documents before planning your trip.
